Static variables are the variables which retain their values between the function calls. They are initialized only once their scope is within the function in which they are defined.,A static variable is a variable that retains its value between function calls and has a scope limited to the file or function it is declared in.,0.86
"Pointers are variables which stores the address of another variable. That variable may be a scalar (including another pointer), or an aggregate (array or structure). The pointed-to object may be part of a larger object, such as a field of a structure or an element in an array.","A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable, allowing indirect access and manipulation of data.",0.9
"Pointer is used in the following cases i) It is used to access array elements ii) It is used for dynamic memory allocation. iii) It is used in Call by reference iv) It is used in data structures like trees, graph, linked list etc.","Pointers are used for dynamic memory allocation, implementing data structures like linked lists, and passing data efficiently between functions.",0.87
Structure constitutes a super data type which represents several different data types in a single unit. A structure can be initialized if it is static or global.,A structure is a user-defined data type that groups related variables of different data types under a single name.,0.82
Union is a collection of heterogeneous data type but it uses efficient memory utilization technique by allocating enough memory to hold the largest member. Here a single area of memory contains values of different types at different time. A union can never be initialized.,"A union is a user-defined data type that allows multiple variables to share the same memory space, with only one of them active at a time.",0.89
"A structure variable contains each of the named members, and its size is large enough to hold all the members. Structure elements are of same size. A union contains one of the named members at a given time and is large enough to hold the largest member. Union element can be of different sizes.","The difference between strdup and strcpy is that strdup dynamically allocates memory for a new string and copies the original string into it, while strcpy copies a string into an existing, already allocated memory location.",0.63
Structure is a collection of heterogeneous data type but array is a collection of homogeneous data types. Array 1-It is a collection of data items of same data type. 2-It has declaration only 3-.There is no keyword. 4- array name represent the address of the starting element. Structure 1-It is a collection of data items of different data type. 2- It has declaration and definition 3- keyword struct is used 4-Structure name is known as tag it is the short hand notation of the declaration.,"Structures are used to group related variables of different data types, while arrays store multiple elements of the same data type; structures have variable size while arrays have fixed size.",0.86
"Functions are declared within header file. That is function prototypes exist in a header file,not function bodies. They are defined in library (lib).","In header files, functions are usually declared, providing their prototypes, while their definitions are found in the corresponding source files.",0.9
"Malloc Calloc 1-Malloc takes one argument Malloc(a);where a number of bytes 2-memory allocated contains garbage values 1-Calloc takes two arguments Calloc(b,c) where b no of object and c size of object www.cpp-progams.blogspot.com Page 6 2-It initializes the contains of block of memory to zerosMalloc takes one argument, memory allocated contains garbage values. It allocates contiguous memory locations. Calloc takes two arguments, memory allocated contains all zeros, and the memory allocated is not contiguous.","A for loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand and has a built-in initialization, condition, and update, while a while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown and continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true.",0.84
